RESPONSE OF PLAINTIFF UNITED STATES TO
PUBLIC COMMENTS ON THE PROPOSED FINAL JUDGMENT
Pursuant to the requirements of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties 
          Act ("APPA" or "Tunney Act"), 15 U.S.C. § 16(b)-(h), the United 
          States hereby files the Comment received from members of the public 
          concerning the proposed Final Judgment in this case and the Response 
          by the United States to the Comment. The United States will move the 
          Court for entry of the proposed Final Judgment after the Comment and 
          this Response have been published in the Federal Register, 
          pursuant to 15 U.S.C. § 16(d). 
         The United States filed a civil antitrust Complaint under Section 
          15 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 25, on October 23, 2007, alleging 
          that the merger of Abitibi-Consolidated Incorporated ("Abitibi") and 
          Bowater Incorporated ("Bowater") would violate Section 7 of the Clayton 
          Act, 15 U.S.C. § 18. Simultaneously with the filing of the Complaint, 
          the United States filed a proposed Final Judgment and an Asset Preservation 
          Stipulation and Order ("Stipulation") signed by plaintiff and defendants 
          consenting to the entry of the proposed Final Judgment after compliance 
          with the requirements of the Tunney Act. Pursuant to those requirements, 
          the United States filed a Competitive Impact Statement ("CIS") in this 
          Court on October 23, 2007, published the proposed Final Judgment and 
          CIS in the Federal Register on November 8, 2007, see United 
          States v. Abitibi-Consolidated Inc. and Bowater Inc., 72 Fed. Reg. 
          63187 (November 8, 2007); and published summaries of the terms of the 
          proposed Final Judgment and CIS, together with directions for the submission 
          of written comments relating to the proposed Final Judgment, in The 
          Washington Post for seven days beginning on November 18, 2007, 
          and ending on November 24, 2007. The 60-day period for public comments 
          ended on January 7, 2008, and one comment was received as described 
          below and attached hereto. 
        


 BACKGROUND: THE UNITED STATES' INVESTIGATION AND THE PROPOSED RESOLUTION 
        

 On January 29, 2007, Abitibi and Bowater announced plans to merge 
          into a new company to be called AbitibiBowater Incorporated ("AbitibiBowater"). 
          Over the next nine months, the United States Department of Justice (the 
          "Department") conducted an extensive, detailed investigation into the 
          competitive effects of the proposed transaction. As part of this investigation, 
          the Department obtained substantial documents and information from the 
          merging parties and issued 37 Civil Investigative Demands to third parties. 
          In response, the Department received and considered more than 150,000 
          pages of material. The Department conducted more than 60 interviews 
          with customers, competitors and other individuals with knowledge of 
          the industry. The sole commenter here, the Newspaper Association of 
          America (the "NAA"), represents newspaper publishers in the United States. 
          During the course of the Department's investigation into the proposed 
          merger, the NAA shared with the investigative staff its concerns about 
          the impact of the proposed merger on competition; the investigative 
          staff carefully analyzed its concerns and submissions, as well as the 
          data, market facts and opinions of other knowledgeable parties. 
         The Department concluded that the combination of Abitibi and Bowater 
          likely would lessen competition in the North American newsprint market. 
          Newspapers are printed on newsprint, the lowest quality and generally 
          the least expensive grade of groundwood paper. Newspaper publishers, 
          who buy more than 80 percent of all newsprint sold in the United States, 
          have no close substitutes to use for printing newspapers because of 
          newsprint's price and physical characteristics. Because publishers' 
          newsprint presses are optimized to use newsprint, switching to another 
          grade of paper would be costly. A small but significant increase in 
          price likely would not cause customers to switch sufficient newsprint 
          tonnes to other products or otherwise curtail their newsprint usage 
          so as to render the increase unprofitable. 
         As explained more fully in the Complaint and CIS, the merger of Abitibi 
          and Bowater would substantially increase concentration and lessen competition 
          in the production, distribution and sale of newsprint in North America. 
          After conducting a detailed analysis of the merger, the Department filed 
          its Complaint alleging competitive harm in the newsprint market in North 
          America and sought a remedy that would ensure that such harm is prevented. 
         The proposed Final Judgment in this case is designed to preserve competition 
          in the production, distribution and sale of newsprint in North America. 
          It requires the divestiture of a newsprint mill that manufactures newsprint 
          for sale in North America. Specifically, the proposed Final Judgment 
          directs a sale of Abitibi's Snowflake, Arizona, newsprint mill ("Snowflake," 
          or the "Snowflake mill") to a purchaser acceptable to the United States. 
         In the Department's judgment, divestiture of the Snowflake mill to 
          a qualified purchaser would remedy the violation alleged in the Complaint 
          because the Snowflake mill, located in northeastern Arizona, is one 
          of the most efficient and profitable newsprint mills in North America. 
          Plans to improve the mill's efficiency in coming years with investments 
          in energy and machinery are already underway. Snowflake's size and cost 
          position ensure that its divestiture to a competitor of the merged firm 
          will preserve competition in the North American newsprint market. Although 
          entry of the proposed Final Judgment would terminate this action, the 
          Court would retain jurisdiction to construe, modify, or enforce the 
          provisions of the proposed Final Judgment and punish violations thereof.(1)



 STANDARD OF JUDICIAL REVIEW
        

 Upon the publication of the Comment and this Response, the United 
          States will have fully complied with the Tunney Act and will move for 
          entry of the proposed Final Judgment as being "in the public interest." 
          15 U.S.C. § 16(e), as amended. 
         The Tunney Act states that, in making that determination, the Court 
          shall consider: 
        
(A) the competitive impact of such judgment, including termination 
          of alleged violations, provisions for enforcement and modification, 
          duration of relief sought, anticipated effects of alternative remedies 
          actually considered, whether its terms are ambiguous, and any other 
          competitive considerations bearing upon the adequacy of such judgment 
          that the court deems necessary to a determination of whether the consent 
          judgment is in the public interest; and 
           (B) the impact of entry of such judgment upon competition in the 
            relevant market or markets, upon the public generally and individuals 
            alleging specific injury from the violations set forth in the complaint 
            including consideration of the public benefit, if any, to be derived 
            from a determination of the issues at trial.
        
15 U.S.C. § 16(e)(1)(A)-(B); see generally United States v. 
          SBC Commc'ns, Inc., 489 F. Supp. 2d 1, 11 (D.D.C. 
          2007) (concluding that the 2004 amendments "effected minimal changes" 
          to scope of review under Tunney Act, leaving review "sharply proscribed 
          by precedent and the nature of Tunney Act proceedings").(2)
 As the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia 
          Circuit has held, under the APPA a court considers, among other things, 
          the relationship between the remedy secured and the specific allegations 
          set forth in the government's complaint, whether the decree is sufficiently 
          clear, whether enforcement mechanisms are sufficient, and whether the 
          decree may positively harm third parties. See United States v. Microsoft 
          Corp., 56 F.3d 1448, 1458-62 (D.C. Cir. 1995). With respect to 
          the adequacy of the relief secured by the decree, a court may not "engage 
          in an unrestricted evaluation of what relief would best serve the public." 
          United States v. BNS, Inc., 858 F.2d 456, 462 (9th Cir. 1988) 
          (citing United States v. Bechtel Corp., 648 F.2d 660, 666 (9th 
          Cir. 1981)); see also Microsoft, 56 F.3d at 1460-62. 
          Courts have held that: 
        
 [t]he balancing of competing social and political interests 
          affected by a proposed antitrust consent decree must be left, in the 
          first instance, to the discretion of the Attorney General. The court's 
          role in protecting the public interest is one of insuring that the government 
          has not breached its duty to the public in consenting to the decree. 
          The court is required to determine not whether a particular decree is 
          the one that will best serve society, but whether the settlement is 
          "within the reaches of the public interest." More elaborate 
          requirements might undermine the effectiveness of antitrust enforcement 
          by consent decree. 
Bechtel, 648 F.2d at 666 (emphasis added) (citations omitted). 
          Cf. BNS, 858 F.2d at 464 (holding that the court's "ultimate 
          authority under the [APPA] is limited to approving or disapproving the 
          consent decree"); United States v. Gillette Co., 406 F. Supp. 
          713, 716 (D. Mass. 1975) (noting that, in this way, the court is constrained 
          to "look at the overall picture not hypercritically, nor with a microscope, 
          but with an artist's reducing glass"). See generally Microsoft, 
          56 F.3d at 1461 (discussing whether "the remedies [obtained in the decree 
          are] so inconsonant with the allegations charged as to fall outside 
          of the 'reaches of the public interest'"). In making its public interest 
          determination, a district court "must accord deference to the government's 
          predictions about the efficacy of its remedies, and may not require 
          that the remedies perfectly match the alleged violations" because this 
          may only reflect underlying weakness in the government's case or concessions 
          made during negotiation. SBC Commc'ns, 489 F. Supp. 2d at 17; 
          see also Microsoft, 56 F.3d at 1461 (noting the need 
          for courts to be "deferential to the government's predictions as to 
          the effect of the proposed remedies"); United States v. Archer-Daniels-Midland 
          Co., 272 F. Supp. 2d 1, 6 (D.D.C. 2003) (noting that the court 
          should grant due respect to the United States' prediction as to the 
          effect of proposed remedies, its perception of the market structure, 
          and its views of the nature of the case). 
         Court approval of a consent decree requires a standard more flexible 
          and less strict than that appropriate to court adoption of a litigated 
          decree following a finding of liability. "[A] proposed decree must be 
          approved even if it falls short of the remedy the court would impose 
          on its own, as long as it falls within the range of acceptability or 
          is 'within the reaches of public interest.'" United States v. Am. 
          Tel. & Tel. Co., 552 F. Supp. 131, 151 (D.D.C. 1982) (citations 
          omitted) (quoting United States v. Gillette Co., 406 F. Supp. 
          713, 716 (D. Mass. 1975)),  aff'd sub nom. Maryland v. 
          United States, 460 U.S. 1001 (1983); see also United 
          States v. Alcan Aluminum Ltd., 605 F. Supp. 619, 622 (W.D. Ky. 
          1985) (approving the consent decree even though the court would have 
          imposed a greater remedy). To meet this standard, the United States 
          "need only provide a factual basis for concluding that the settlements 
          are reasonably adequate remedies for the alleged harms." SBC Commc'ns, 
          489 F. Supp. 2d at 17. 
         Moreover, the Court's role under the APPA is limited to reviewing 
          the remedy in relationship to the violations that the United States 
          has alleged in its complaint, and does not authorize the Court to "construct 
          [its] own hypothetical case and then evaluate the decree against that 
          case." Microsoft, 56 F.3d at 1459. Because the "court's authority 
          to review the decree depends entirely on the government's exercising 
          its prosecutorial discretion by bringing a case in the first place," 
          it follows that "the court is only authorized to review the decree itself," 
          and not to "effectively redraft the complaint" to inquire into other 
          matters that the United States did not pursue. Id. at 1459-60. 
          As this Court recently confirmed in SBC Communications, courts 
          "cannot look beyond the complaint in making the public interest determination 
          unless the complaint is drafted so narrowly as to make a mockery of 
          judicial power." SBC Commc'ns 489 F. Supp. 2d at 15. 
         In its 2004 amendments, Congress made clear its intent to preserve 
          the practical benefits of utilizing consent decrees in antitrust enforcement, 
          adding the unambiguous instruction "[n]othing in this section shall 
          be construed to require the court to conduct an evidentiary hearing 
          or to require the court to permit anyone to intervene." 15 U.S.C. § 
          16(e)(2). The language wrote into the statute what the Congress that 
          enacted the Tunney Act in 1974 intended, as Senator Tunney then explained: 
          "[t]he court is nowhere compelled to go to trial or to engage in extended 
          proceedings which might have the effect of vitiating the benefits of 
          prompt and less costly settlement through the consent decree process." 
          119 Cong. Rec. 24,598 (1973) (statement of Senator Tunney). Rather, 
          the procedure for the public interest determination is left to the discretion 
          of the court, with the recognition that the court's "scope of review 
          remains sharply proscribed by precedent and the nature of Tunney Act 
          proceedings." SBC Commc'ns, 489 F. Supp. 2d at 11.(3)



 SUMMARY OF THE COMMENT AND RESPONSE
        

 During the 60-day comment period, the United States received one Comment, 
          from the NAA. That Comment is attached to this memo. After reviewing 
          the Comment, the United States continues to believe that the proposed 
          Final Judgment is in the public interest. The Comment includes concerns 
          relating to whether the proposed Final Judgment adequately remedies 
          the harms alleged in the Complaint. The United States addresses these 
          concerns below and explains how the remedy is appropriate. 
        



 Summary of Comment Submitted by the NAA
          


 The NAA is an association whose members include daily and Sunday newspapers 
          in the United States who purchase a significant proportion of North 
          America's newsprint production. In its Comment of January 2, 2008, the 
          NAA expressed concerns relating to whether the proposed Final Judgment 
          adequately remedies the alleged harms. The NAA argued in its Comment 
          that the Court should not enter the proposed Final Judgment without 
          a hearing for two reasons: (1) the newly merged AbitibiBowater, despite 
          its agreement to divest the Snowflake mill, "has already begun to exercise 
          the market power created by the merger to anticompetitively raise newsprint 
          prices to North American newsprint customers;" and (2) the United States 
          "has not provided the Court with any factual or economic analysis to 
          demonstrate that the proposed remedy will eliminate the incentive for 
          AbitibiBowater to reduce industry capacity and raise prices to North 
          American newsprint customers." (NAA Comment at 2.) 
        




 The NAA's argument that AbitibiBowater has already begun to 
                exercise market power and anticompetitively raise newsprint prices
            



 The NAA notes that a little more than five weeks following the merger 
          that created AbitibiBowater, the combined firm announced that it would 
          remove 600,000 metric tonnes of newsprint capacity from the North American 
          market and would raise newsprint prices by $60 per metric tonne, to 
          be implemented in three $20 price increases. The NAA further notes that 
          "[m]ost" North American newsprint manufacturers not only joined AbitibiBowater's 
          price increase but also implemented a "previously stalled" price increase 
          of $25 per metric tonne. The NAA estimated that, taken together, these 
          two price increases constitute a 15 percent price increase as compared 
          to the pre-merger, October 2007, price for newsprint. The NAA also noted 
          that, at the time AbitibiBowater announced the removal of 600,000 metric 
          tonnes of newsprint capacity from the North American market, it also 
          announced that "more mills could close in Canada later [in 2008]." (Comment 
          at 7.) 
         The NAA claims that these post-merger actions by AbitibiBowater demonstrate 
          that the United States "severely underestimated the risk that the merger 
          posed to competition in the North American newsprint market and severely 
          underestimated the incentive and ability of the merged firm to remove 
          capacity from the market to raise the price of newsprint well above 
          competitive levels." (Comment at 7.) Accordingly, the NAA contends that 
          a "significantly larger divestiture" than the Snowflake mill is required 
          to prevent "the substantial anticompetitive price increases that are 
          already occurring and will continue to occur as a result of the merger." 
          (Comment at 7.) 
        




 The NAA's argument that the United States has not provided 
                adequate factual or legal analysis upon which to base a public 
                interest determination
            



 The NAA concedes that in the Complaint, the United States "correctly 
          identifies the competitive harm produced by the merger." (Comment at 
          9.) The NAA argues, however, that the United States has not provided 
          the Court with a factual or legal analysis to demonstrate that the divestiture 
          of the Snowflake mill will "eliminate the incentive to reduce industry 
          capacity and raise prices to North American newsprint customers," and 
          thus has provided the Court with no basis by which to determine if the 
          proposed remedy is in the public interest. (Comment at 9.) Specifically, 
          the NAA argues that, other than noting that Snowflake is "among the 
          largest and most profitable mills in the United States," the United 
          States "provided no further explanation for its decision that Snowflake 
          was both a sufficient remedy and the best solution, no detail regarding 
          under what 'circumstances' this conclusion was reached, and no scale 
          against which it measured Snowflake as the best alternative." (Comment 
          at 17.) 
         The NAA contends that the proposed Final Judgment should not be entered 
          because the United States has not explained to the Court "why the remedy 
          it proposes restores or preserves competition." (Comment at 19.) In 
          particular, the NAA criticizes the United States for failing to reference 
          in the Complaint or CIS what the NAA describes as historical anticompetitive 
          behavior of Abitibi and Bowater, and it contends that absent such references, 
          it is impossible for the Court to determine if and how much of a factor 
          such conduct played in the United States' evaluation and settlement 
          of the merger. The NAA also criticizes the United States for failing 
          to discuss the anticipated effects of alternative remedies actually 
          considered. 
        



 Response of the United States to the NAA's Comment
          


 The divestiture of the Snowflake mill adequately remedies the harm 
          alleged in the Complaint. In negotiating this remedy, the United States 
          carefully considered the capabilities and economic viability of the 
          Snowflake mill as well as other assets of the merging parties; the extent 
          of industry excess capacity; the history of declining demand for newsprint, 
          and the forecasts for that decline to continue; the costs of production 
          of all newsprint mills in North America; and the financial viability 
          of the merging parties and their competitors. After considering these 
          issues, the United States analyzed the merger using a comprehensive 
          data set of prices, sales, production volumes and costs, capacities 
          and forecasts of North American newsprint demand. In its analysis, which 
          drew upon non-public information unavailable to the NAA, the United 
          States concluded that the divestiture of the Snowflake mill to a viable 
          qualified purchaser will adequately redress the competitive harm alleged 
          in the Complaint and restore competition to the market for the sale 
          of newsprint in North America. 
         The United States and the NAA employed the same general economic model 
          to examine the competitive effects of the merger. Accurate data about 
          prices, manufacturing costs, the elasticity of demand and other factors 
          can allow economists to model whether merging firms have an added incentive 
          to exercise market power by reducing capacity after a merger. The United 
          States and the NAA both attempted to determine whether the merger will 
          cause the combined AbitibiBowater to eliminate newsprint capacity earlier 
          than Abitibi and Bowater would have if they had remained independent 
          competitors. 
         Although the United States and the NAA used a similar framework to 
          model competition, the results differed significantly because of several 
          important differences in the data. First, the United States had more 
          complete and accurate data. Unlike the NAA, the United States was able 
          use compulsory process to gather information. See, e.g., 15 U.S.C. 1311-14 
          (empowering the Antitrust Division to subpoena documents and take oral 
          testimony). In this case, the United States had access to extensive 
          and mill-by-mill data on sales (including exports), production volumes, 
          capacities and costs. The NAA, on the other hand, had to rely on less 
          accurate and publicly available information relating to mill capacities, 
          prices and costs in assessing the profitability of and competitors' 
          likely response to a post-merger price increase. Second, the United 
          States conducted its own analysis of the effect of price changes on 
          the demand for newsprint, using confidential information, in addition 
          to considering estimates provided by others. Based upon its analysis, 
          the United States believes that the estimate used by NAA understates 
          the sensitivity of newsprint consumption to changes in price. In other 
          words, the United States believes that if the price for newsprint rose, 
          customers would purchase less newsprint than the NAA estimates. Third, 
          the United States and the NAA viewed 2007 differently. While the NAA 
          assumed that the newsprint market in 2007 was in equilibrium ­ 
          which would allow that year's prices to be used as a reference point 
          from which to measure future changes ­ the United States' investigation 
          revealed that much of 2007 was a period of instability. Unexpectedly 
          large declines in demand for newsprint created excess capacity and caused 
          prices to fall dramatically. The fact that AbitibiBowater and other 
          firms responded to declining demand for newsprint by closing mills that 
          were consistently losing money is discussed in further detail in the 
          following section. 
         The United States is confident that at the time it negotiated the 
          proposed Final Judgment the divestiture of the Snowflake mill was in 
          the public interest, based upon the best information available at that 
          time. The United States remains confident that the divestiture of the 
          Snowflake mill is in the public interest and adequately remedies the 
          harms alleged in the Complaint. 
        




 AbitibiBowater's recently announced decision to reduce excess 
                newsprint capacity, and industry-wide price increases, do not 
                mean that the parties have exercised market power
            



 The NAA's argument, that the Snowflake mill divestiture is insufficient 
          to prevent the combined firm from exercising market power by shutting 
          additional capacity in order to raise prices, assumes that the combined 
          firm's post-merger capacity reductions are the result of the merger. 
          The NAA's suggestions to the contrary, events since the filing of the 
          proposed Final Judgment appear to be unrelated to any exercise of market 
          power. The ongoing sharp decline in demand for newsprint in North America, 
          increases in the prices of key inputs into the production of newsprint, 
          and the continued decline in the value of the United States dollar all 
          have disrupted the supply and demand equilibrium for newsprint. Industry 
          observers expect disruptions to continue as North American demand for 
          newsprint declines. Manufacturers will respond by intermittently closing 
          capacity, which will cause the market price to lurch from one equilibrium 
          to another as it adjusts to these shocks to supply. Thus, in a market 
          with declining demand, prices can be expected to fall when the decline 
          in demand creates excess supply and increase when unprofitable capacity 
          is closed in response to that decline in demand. In the remainder of 
          this section, we will discuss the effects of these trends on the newsprint 
          market and show that a careful analysis suggests that the NAA's claims 
          are unfounded. 
         Demand for newsprint in the North American market "has declined over 
          the last several years at a rate of approximately 5 to 10 percent per 
          year because of a significant decline in demand for newspapers. . . 
          . This decline in the demand for newsprint is projected to continue, 
          and the resulting excess newsprint capacity will likely lead Defendants 
          and their competitors to close, idle or convert more newsprint mills." 
          (Complaint at ¶ 17; see also CIS at 5.) As North American 
          demand continues to decline, notwithstanding the merger, all firms, 
          including AbitibiBowater, will eventually have to close inefficient 
          newsprint capacity. In its Comment, the NAA ignores the possibility 
          that AbitibiBowater's post-merger decision to close some of its inefficient 
          capacity was a natural reaction to the continued decline in demand for 
          newsprint and may in fact be perfectly consistent with a competitive 
          market. 
         The pressure to close inefficient capacity also intensified in 2007 
          because the prices of key production inputs--specifically, recycled 
          fiber, wood pulp and energy -- rose sharply. This increase in input 
          costs has raised the costs of all producers and put upward pressure 
          on the price of newsprint. Further, the United States dollar has lost 
          value relative to the Canadian dollar, which has the effect of raising 
          the costs of Canadian producers of newsprint--the bulk of North American 
          newsprint capacity is located in Canada--and hence the price of newsprint. 
         Finally, the adjustment of the newsprint market to these disruptive 
          market conditions will not be instantaneous or smooth. Because newsprint 
          mills have very significant fixed costs and relatively smaller incremental 
          costs, newsprint manufacturers may not be able to respond to declining 
          demand by gradually withdrawing capacity. The market therefore can be 
          expected to swing between periods of overcapacity and shortage as companies 
          retire paper machines or entire paper mills. As these swings occur, 
          there will not be smooth changes to the industry's overall capacity 
          or its price levels. For example, while the price of newsprint has risen 
          in the past six months, it is at the time of this filing at or below 
          its lowest level in 2006 when input prices were lower. Further, 
          the United States' investigation has found that the price is so low 
          that many newsprint producers' mills do not cover their costs. Indeed, 
          the three mills that AbitibiBowater closed after the merger were unprofitable. 
         In summary, the NAA's conclusion that recent newsprint capacity closures 
          and price increases necessarily are anticompetitive actions driven by 
          the merger is misguided and fails to account for significant market 
          facts affecting the supply and demand equilibrium of the North American 
          newsprint market. 





 The United States has provided sufficient explanation of why 
                the proposed divestiture is an adequate remedy to the harm alleged 
                in the Complaint, and entry of the proposed Final Judgment will 
                be in the public interest
            



 The proposed Final Judgment provides an effective and appropriate 
          remedy for the antitrust violation alleged in the Complaint, and its 
          entry, therefore, will be in the public interest. The purpose of Tunney 
          Act review is not for the Court to engage in an "unrestricted evaluation 
          of what relief would best serve the public," BNS, 858 F.2d 
          at 462 (citing Bechtel Corp., 648 F.2d at 666) or to determine 
          the relief "that will best serve society," Bechtel Corp., 648 
          F.2d at 666. Instead, the purpose of Tunney Act review is simply to 
          determine whether the divestiture of the Snowflake mill is within the 
          reaches of the public interest, "even if it falls short of the remedy 
          the court would impose on its own." AT&T, 552 F.Supp. at 
          151. In other words, the purpose of Tunney Act review is to determine 
          whether the divestiture is a "reasonably adequate" remedy for the harms 
          alleged in the Complaint. SBC Commc'ns, 489 F.Supp. 2d at 17. 
         Subsections (A) and (B) of 15 U.S.C. § 16(e)(1) set forth a number 
          of factors for courts to consider when assessing the competitive impact 
          of proposed final judgments. Many of those factors are not at issue 
          here.(4) Instead, the second argument 
          in the NAA's Comment focuses on the competitive considerations relevant 
          to the proposed Final Judgment, the divestiture it requires and the 
          alternatives the United States considered. 
         The NAA questions whether the United States has adequately demonstrated 
          to this Court that the divestiture eliminates AbitibiBowater's post-merger 
          incentive to reduce capacity and raise prices to North American newsprint 
          customers. It has. As explained previously, the United States conducted 
          an extensive investigation and compiled comprehensive data on market 
          shares, costs of production, estimations of rest-of-industry newsprint 
          capacity and future reductions in newsprint demand gathered from public 
          and non-public sources. This data was used in an economic model to determine 
          if the merger would cause an anticompetitive increase in newsprint prices.(5) 
          The United States concluded that a merger between Abitibi and Bowater, 
          without a divestiture, would allow the merged firm to "close its capacity 
          strategically, allowing the merged firm to raise newsprint prices and 
          recoup its lost profits on the combined output." (CIS at 8.) But, as 
          the United States concluded in the CIS, "[d]ivesting Snowflake . . . 
          will reduce the capacity over which the merged firm could profit to 
          a level at which it would not have the ability to close capacity strategically." 
          (Id.) In other words, the United States' investigation found 
          that without Snowflake, AbitibiBowater did not have enough newsprint 
          capacity to benefit sufficiently from the post-merger price increase 
          to offset the costs associated with shutting down profitable newsprint 
          capacity. 
         The NAA further contends that the United States "has left the Court 
          entirely in the dark with absolutely no basis for making a meaningful 
          comparison between a Snowflake-only divestiture and any alternative 
          course of action, including a full trial on the merits." (Comment at 
          18.) This is incorrect; in the CIS the United States addressed both 
          alternatives. (CIS at 10-11.) As the United States noted in the CIS, 
          a full trial on the merits would require significant time and expense, 
          and the outcome would be uncertain. In light of such uncertainty, the 
          United States' decision to take an adequate and available remedy and 
          forgo the risk of trial is well within "the reaches of the public interest." 
          See SBC Commc'ns, 489 F. Supp. 2d at 23 ("Success at trial 
          was surely not assured, so pursuit of that alternative may have resulted 
          in no remedy at all. While a trial may have created an even greater 
          evidentiary record, that benefit may not outweigh the possible loss 
          of the settlement remedies. . . ."). 
         Similarly, the United States need not rehearse every permutation of 
          possible divestiture in order to demonstrate to this Court that the 
          divestiture of Snowflake would adequately address the competitive harm 
          alleged in the Complaint. The competitive harm that the United States 
          alleged ­ and that the NAA acknowledges ­ is AbitibiBowater's 
          incentive and ability to raise newsprint prices above competitive levels 
          in the North American market. Any divestiture that removes either the 
          combined firm's incentive or its ability to raise prices above competitive 
          levels would therefore be an adequate remedy. Given AbitibiBowater's 
          ownership of all or part of 19 paper mills in the United States and 
          Canada (see Complaint ¶¶ 7 & 8), the United States 
          could have selected different mills, individually or in combination, 
          to remove the merged firm's ability and incentive to raise prices anticompetitively. 
          In this instance, considering all the factors ­ including the inherent 
          advantages of settlement and avoidance of the risk and uncertainty of 
          litigation(6) ­ the United States 
          reasonably chose to require the divestiture of one of "the largest and 
          most profitable newsprint mills in the United States," which its analysis 
          determined would deprive the merged firm of the scale needed to recoup 
          its lost profits. (See CIS at 6, 11.) As discussed above, given 
          the continuing decline in demand for newsprint, the United States anticipated 
          that AbitibiBowater would continue to close inefficient newsprint capacity. 
          (See Complaint at ¶ 17, CIS at 5.) The United States determined 
          that, coupled with the exit from the market of such inefficient capacity, 
          the divestiture of the Snowflake mill will be sufficient to prevent 
          AbitibiBowater from engaging in an anticompetitive closure of efficient 
          capacity. Abitibi and Bowater, even before the merger, had the incentive 
          to close money-losing mills. The question therefore is whether the merger 
          somehow gave them the incentive to close profitable mills in order to 
          raise prices above competitive levels. The United States determined 
          that AbitibiBowater was not likely to have that incentive once it divested 
          Snowflake. 
         Finally, the NAA suggests that the proposed Final Judgment should 
          not be entered because Abitibi and Bowater previously had engaged in 
          anticompetitive conduct of the sort alleged in the Complaint, which 
          it alleges the United States did not properly account for in negotiating 
          the proposed Final Judgment. This suggestion is misplaced for two reasons. 
          First, as mentioned earlier, the United States spoke with a number of 
          market participants, including the NAA, and examined historical data 
          on prices and costs in the course of its investigation. The evidence 
          does not support the NAA's claims that the parties' prior behavior was 
          in fact anticompetitive. Second, the NAA's allegations about the parties' 
          prior behavior are irrelevant because the prior behavior does not address 
          whether, after Snowflake is divested, AbitibiBowater will have the incentive 
          and ability to unilaterally raise price above competitive levels. (And 
          as the United States has already explained, the answer to this question 
          is likely to be "no.") 
         Ultimately, in making its public interest determination, the district 
          court "must accord deference to the government's predictions about the 
          efficacy of its remedies." See SBC Commc'ns, 489 F. 
          Supp. 2d at 17. As already has been demonstrated, the United States' 
          analysis supports the conclusion that divestiture of the Snowflake mill 
          is an appropriate remedy to the harms alleged in the Complaint. 
        


 CONCLUSION
        

 The issues raised in the NAA's public Comment were among the many 
          considered during the United States' extensive and thorough investigation. 
          The United States has determined that the proposed Final Judgment as 
          drafted provides an effective and appropriate remedy for the antitrust 
          violations alleged in the Complaint, and is therefore in the public 
          interest. The United States will move this Court to enter the proposed 
          Final Judgment after the Comment and Response are published.

FOOTNOTES

1.  The merger closed on October 29, 2007. In keeping 
          with the United States' standard practice, neither the Stipulation nor 
          the proposed Final Judgment prohibited closing the merger.  See 
          ABA Section of Antitrust Law, Antitrust Law Developments 406 
          (6th ed. 2007) (noting that "[t]he Federal Trade Commission (as well 
          as the Department of Justice) generally will permit the underlying transaction 
          to close during the notice and comment period"). Such a prohibition 
          could interfere with many time-sensitive deals and prevent or delay 
          the realization of substantial efficiencies. In consent decrees requiring 
          divestitures, it is also standard practice to include a "preservation 
          of assets" clause in the decree and to file a stipulation to ensure 
          that the assets to be divested remain competitively viable. That practice 
          was followed here. Proposed Final Judgment § IV(K). In addition, 
          the Stipulation entered by the Court in this case required AbitibiBowater 
          to hold separate the Snowflake newsprint mill, pending the divestiture 
          contemplated by the proposed Final Judgment. 
        2.  The 2004 amendments substituted "shall" for 
          "may" in directing relevant factors for court to consider and amended 
          the list of factors to focus on competitive considerations and to address 
          potentially ambiguous judgment terms. Compare 15 U.S.C. § 
          16(e) (2004), with 15 U.S.C. § 16(e)(1) (2006). 
3.  See United States v. Enova Corp., 107 
          F. Supp. 2d 10, 17 (D.D.C. 2000) (noting that the "Tunney Act expressly 
          allows the court to make its public interest determination on the basis 
          of the competitive impact statement and response to comments alone"); 
          United States v. Mid-Am. Dairymen, Inc., 1977-1 Trade Cas. 
          (CCH) ¶ 61,508, at 71,980 (W.D. Mo. 1977) ("Absent a showing of 
          corrupt failure of the government to discharge its duty, the Court, 
          in making its public interest finding, should . . . carefully consider 
          the explanations of the government in the competitive impact statement 
          and its responses to comments in order to determine whether those explanations 
          are reasonable under the circumstances."); S. Rep. No. 93-298, 93d Cong., 
          1st Sess., at 6 (1973) ("Where the public interest can be meaningfully 
          evaluated simply on the basis of briefs and oral arguments, that is 
          the approach that should be utilized."). 
        4.  The NAA does not contest several factors listed 
          for courts to consider under subsection (A). For instance, with respect 
          to "provisions for enforcement and modification," 15 U.S.C. 16(e)(1)(A), 
          the proposed Final Judgment contains the standard provisions that have 
          been effective in numerous other cases brought by the United States. 
          In particular, the proposed Final Judgment provides that the Court retains 
          jurisdiction over this action, and the parties may apply to the Court 
          for any order necessary or appropriate for the modification, interpretation, 
          or enforcement of the Final Judgment. With respect to "duration of relief 
          sought," id., the proposed divestiture is permanent. Finally, 
          with respect to "whether its terms are ambiguous," id., no 
          term in the proposed Final Judgment is ambiguous. 
        5. To raise prices above competitive levels, the 
          merged firm must create an artificial shortage by shutting down profitable 
          newsprint mills. The merged firm has the incentive to follow this strategy 
          when the costs of this strategy, which are the profits the merged firm 
          forgoes by prematurely shutting down profitable newsprint mills, are 
          less than its benefits, which are the increased prices the merged firm 
          can expect to recoup across its remaining newsprint capacity. After 
          completing its investigation, the United States concluded that without 
          a divestiture AbitibiBowater would have the incentive to follow this 
          strategy, that is, to create an artificial shortage by shutting down 
          otherwise-profitable newsprint mills. 
        6.  As noted previously, when making its public 
          interest determination, this Court "must accord deference to the government's 
          predictions about the efficacy of its remedies, and may not require 
          that the remedies perfectly match the alleged violations because this 
          may only reflect underlying weakness in the government's case or concessions 
          made during negotiation." SBC Commc'ns, 489 F. Supp. 2d at 
          17.
