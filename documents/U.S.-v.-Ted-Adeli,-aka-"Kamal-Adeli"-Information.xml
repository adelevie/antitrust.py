THE UNITED STATES CHARGES: 
        

INTRODUCTION

 At all times relevant to this Information, unless otherwise indicated: 
        

The Defendant

 1. The defendant TED ADELI, also known as "Kamal Adeli," resided in 
          Bayside, New York. The defendant TED ADELI was a real estate speculator 
          doing business in Queens, New York. At various times the defendant TED 
          ADELI was an officer and owner of Advance Home Sales and Silver Development 
          Corp. These businesses were located in Queens, New York. 
        

Foreclosure Proceedings

 2. In Queens County, New York, foreclosure proceedings were initiated 
          by the mortgage holder (generally a bank) suing the property owner for 
          defaulting on the mortgage loan and seeking to foreclose on the property 
          that secured the loan. When a judgment was rendered for a mortgage holder, 
          the amount generally included, among other things, the remaining balance 
          on the loan secured by the mortgage, interest, and penalties. 
         3. Once a mortgage holder obtained a judgment, the judge presiding 
          over the foreclosure proceeding would appoint a Referee to conduct a 
          sale of the property by public auction. The Referee was responsible 
          for providing the notice required by New York state law that there would 
          be a foreclosure auction on the date and time specified in the notice. 
          The Referee then held the public foreclosure auction. The foreclosure 
          auctions were usually held at the Queens County Courthouse, located 
          on Sutphin Boulevard in Jamaica, New York. 
         4. The bidding at a public foreclosure auction typically opened at 
          the mortgage holder's "upset price." The upset price was sometimes the 
          amount of the judgment obtained by the mortgage holder against the property 
          owner, but was often less, depending on market conditions or the condition 
          of the property. The Referee sought the highest price possible at the 
          public foreclosure auction by soliciting open and competitive bidding 
          from potential purchasers and selecting the highest bid as the price 
          at which to sell the property. 
         5. Immediately after the auction, the highest bidder paid a 10% deposit 
          to the Referee by cashier's or certified check. The Referee and the 
          highest bidder then completed the "Terms of Sale." The Terms of Sale 
          included, among other things, the property's address, the date of the 
          auction, the name of the highest bidder, the amount of the winning bid, 
          and the amount of the deposit paid. The highest bidder needed the Terms 
          of Sale to complete the settlement of the property transaction (also 
          called "closing"), which usually occurred within 30 days of the auction. 
          Once the closing was completed, the highest bidder took title to the 
          property. 
         6. At the closing on a property purchased at a public foreclosure 
          auction, the Referee was responsible for obtaining the balance due on 
          the property from the successful bidder or his assignee. The Referee 
          was also then responsible for distributing the proceeds to the mortgage 
          holder in total or partial satisfaction of the judgment. Any money paid 
          for the property above the amount owed to the mortgage holder represented 
          a "surplus," which the Referee would then deposit with the Queens County 
          Clerk. Other lienholders and the foreclosed property owner could then 
          make a claim on that surplus money. 
        

The Conspiracy's Effect on Interstate Commerce

 7. The defendant TED ADELI and his co-conspirators regularly bought 
          residential properties at foreclosure auctions held at the Queens County 
          Courthouse. 
         8. Many mortgage holders involved in the foreclosure auctions in Queens 
          County were either out-of-state lenders or New York lenders with out-of-state 
          mortgage processing operations. Consequently, in connection with many 
          properties purchased at public foreclosure auctions by the defendant 
          or his co-conspirators pursuant to the conspiracy charged below, money 
          and documents moved across state lines as part of those transactions. 
          Those business activities were within the flow of, and substantially 
          affected, interstate trade and commerce. 
        

SHERMAN ACT CONSPIRACY

 9. Paragraphs one through eight are realleged and incorporated by 
          reference as though fully set forth herein. 
         10. In or about and between January 1992 and January 1995, both dates 
          being approximate and inclusive, the defendant TED ADELI, also known 
          as "Kamal Adeli," and others entered into and engaged in a combination 
          and conspiracy that illegally restrained interstate trade and commerce 
          in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. The charged combination 
          and conspiracy consisted of a continuing agreement, understanding, and 
          concert of action among the defendant and co-conspirators, the substantial 
          term of which was to suppress competition by refraining from full competitive 
          bidding at certain public foreclosure auctions held in Queens County, 
          in the Eastern District of New York. 
         11. It was part of the conspiracy that the defendant TED ADELI and 
          his co-conspirators agreed not to bid against each other at public foreclosure 
          auctions at the Queens County Courthouse. As a result, the conspirators 
          purchased auctioned property at prices lower than would have resulted 
          from a fully competitive auction, thereby depriving mortgage holders, 
          lienholders, and property owners of the full value of the auctioned 
          property. 
         12. It was further part of the conspiracy that after the public foreclosure 
          auction, the defendant TED ADELI and his co-conspirators would hold 
          a second, private auction, open only to the conspirators and generally 
          conducted by written bid, in which the conspirators would bid to acquire 
          the foreclosed property at a price higher than the price paid by the 
          conspirators' designated bidder at the public foreclosure auction. 
         13. It was further part of the conspiracy that the defendant TED ADELI 
          and his co-conspirators would award the property to the conspirator 
          with the highest bid at the private auction. The conspirators would 
          then divide among themselves the difference between the prices paid 
          at the public foreclosure auction and the private auction. 
         14. It was further part of the conspiracy that following the private 
          auction, the conspirator who was the highest bidder at the public foreclosure 
          auction would assign his right to purchase the property to the conspirator 
          who was the highest bidder at the private auction. 
         15. It was further part of the conspiracy that the conspirator who 
          submitted the highest bid during the private auction could thereafter: 
          (1) proceed to close on the property with the Referee at the price set 
          during the rigged, public auction, or (2) sell his right to close on 
          the property at the price set during the rigged auction to a third party. 
         (Title 15, United States Code, Section 1; Title 18 United States Code, 
          Section 3551 et seq.)
