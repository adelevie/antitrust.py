 RESPONSE OF PLAINTIFF UNITED STATES TO THE NAA'S MOTION FOR
LEAVE TO APPEAR AS AMICUS CURIAE 

 The United States opposes the Newspaper Association of America's (the 
          "NAA") Motion For Leave To Appear As Amicus Curiae ("Motion") in this 
          Tunney Act (the "Act") proceeding. Under the Act, the Court must determine 
          whether entry of the proposed Final Judgment is in the public interest. 
          As Congress anticipated, courts typically make this determination on 
          the basis of the information, including public comments, that the Act 
          requires the United States to file with the Court. In this case, the 
          NAA submitted an extensive public comment, to which the United States 
          has responded.(1) Any additional information 
          that the NAA would submit, as far as can be determined from the NAA's 
          Motion, would largely duplicate its comment.(2) 
          The Court should therefore deny the NAA's Motion. 
        INTRODUCTION 
 1. The Tunney Act. The Court must find that the proposed 
          Final Judgment is in the public interest before entering the Final Judgment. 
          15 U.S.C. § 16(e). The Act, which governs the Court's public 
          interest determination, sets forth a public comment process requiring 
          that the United States (1) publish notices in newspapers and the 
          Federal Register; (2) file and publish a Competitive Impact 
          Statement ("CIS") describing, among other things, the antitrust violation 
          and the proposed decree; and (3) file with the Court and publish 
          in the Federal Register any public comments received and its 
          response to those comments. Id. § 16(b)-(d). The 
          public comment process gives the Court, as well as the United States, 
          the benefit of views of interested nonparties prior to making its public 
          interest determination. 
         The Act enumerates factors the Court is to consider in making its 
          public interest determination. Id. § 16(e)(1). The Court 
          may make its determination based on the information provided by the 
          Complaint, proposed Final Judgment, CIS, public comments, and the government's 
          response to comments. If the Court concludes that the information is 
          insufficient and it needs more, the Act provides a wide array of tools 
          for obtaining more. Id. § 16(f); see also id. 
          § 16(e)(2). ("Nothing in this section shall be 
          construed to require the court to conduct an evidentiary hearing or 
          to require the court to permit anyone to intervene."). 
         2. Proceedings to date. On October 23, 2007, the 
          United States filed a Complaint alleging that the merger of Abitibi-Consolidated, 
          Inc. ("Abitibi") and Bowater Incorporated ("Bowater") violated Section 
          7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 18. At the same time, the 
          United States filed a proposed Final Judgment, to which the defendants 
          had consented, requiring the divestiture of the Abitibi paper mill in 
          Snowflake, Arizona, to remedy the harms alleged in the Complaint. See 
          15 U.S.C. § 16(b)-(h). Also on October 23, 2007, the United 
          States filed its CIS, see id. § 16(b), analyzing 
          the violation alleged in the Complaint and the remedies in the proposed 
          Final Judgment for the competitive harms the proposed merger would create 
          if consummated as Abitibi and Bowater had planned. The United States 
          published the proposed Final Judgment and CIS in the Federal Register 
          on November 8, 2007, United States v. Abitibi-Consolidated 
          Inc. and Bowater Inc., 72 Fed. Reg. 63,187 (November 8, 2007); 
          15 U.S.C. §16(b), and published summaries of the terms of the proposed 
          Final Judgment and CIS, together with directions for the submission 
          of written comments relating to the proposed Final Judgment, in The 
          Washington Post for seven days beginning on November 18, 2007, 
          and ending on November 24, 2007, see id. § 16(c). 
          The comment period expired on January 7, 2008. 
         During the comment period, the United States received only one comment. 
          On January 2, 2008, the NAA submitted a 23-page comment accompanied 
          by over 200 pages of supporting materials ­ including 183 pages 
          of economic analysis of the Abitibi-Bowater transaction prepared by 
          an economic consulting firm. The United States filed its response to 
          the NAA's comment, along with the comment itself, on April 18, 2008.(3)
 3. The NAA's Motion.  Without considering the government's 
          response to its comment, the NAA filed the instant Motion seeking leave 
          to appear as amicus curiae, to introduce evidence, to file a brief, 
          and to participate in a hearing or Special Master proceeding. 
        

ARGUMENT



            The Court Should Deny the NAA's Motion 
          

 The NAA provides no sound reason for granting its Motion. This proceeding 
          is not a trial on the merits. It is a statutory proceeding to determine 
          whether it would be in the public interest for the Court to enter the 
          proposed Final Judgment. 15 U.S.C. § 16(e). The Act requires 
          the United States to provide the Court with substantial information 
          relevant to the Court's determination, including the views and analyses 
          of interested third parties. Id. §§ 16(b) & 
          (d). This information is ordinarily sufficient to support a court's 
          determination. However, the Act also permits the Court to employ an 
          array of techniques for gathering additional information, id. 
          § 16(f), when necessary to make its public interest determination. 
          The Court could take advantage of these techniques as the NAA proposes. 
          However, the NAA's Motion makes clear that what NAA seeks to provide 
          to the Court would be entirely redundant, or nearly so, in light of 
          the material already before the Court, much of which was provided originally 
          by NAA itself. Accordingly, there is no sound reason to grant the NAA's 
          Motion and the Court should reject its Motion. 
        

 The Court Should Base Its Public Interest Determination On The 
            Mandatory Tunney Act Materials Unless They Inadequately Inform The 
            Court's Public Interest Determination 


 This proceeding is not a trial on the merits. The parties to the underlying 
          antitrust dispute have resolved their differences, and the Court therefore 
          does not face the classic judicial task of "[r]esolving contested disputes" 
          of fact, law, and remedy.(4) The Act 
          requires that the government provide the Court with substantial information 
          relevant to its public interest determination, including the Complaint, 
          the proposed decree, the CIS, any comments submitted to the government 
          by interested third parties, and the government's response to those 
          comments. 15 U.S.C. §§ 16(b) & (d). Congress contemplated 
          that these materials would often suffice.(5) 
          Congress reiterated its understanding in the 2004 Amendments to the 
          Act by providing in 15 U.S.C. § 16(e)(2) that "Nothing in this 
          section shall be construed to require the court to conduct an evidentiary 
          hearing or to require the court to permit anyone to intervene." 
         The Act provides a wide array of optional tools which the Court may 
          employ to gather additional information, 15 U.S.C. § 16(f), 
          but the Court should exercise its discretion to employ these tools only 
          when it is necessary to do so. To do otherwise would conflict with the 
          principle that "the trial judge will adduce the necessary information 
          through the least . . . complicated and least time-consuming 
          means possible," S. Rep. No. 93-298 at 6 (1973) (Senate Report). Ordinarily, 
          courts do not find it necessary to employ these additional tools in 
          Act proceedings. Thus, for example, Judge Greene, considering the entry 
          of a decree that would massively restructure the entire telecommunications 
          industry, "concluded that none of the issues before [the Court] require[d] 
          an evidentiary hearing. That being so, there [was] obviously no need, 
          nor indeed any occasion, for the presentation by a third party of its 
          own witnesses or for the cross-examination of adverse witnesses." United 
          States v. AT&T, 552 F. Supp. 131, 219 (D.D.C. 1982), aff'd
mem. sub. nom. Maryland v. United States, 460 U.S. 
          1001 (1983). 
        

The NAA Fails To Show How Its Participation Would Be Helpful To 
            The Court 


 The United States believes that the record in this proceeding includes 
          sufficient information to properly inform the Court's public interest 
          determination. Thus, though it is it certainly at the Court's discretion, 
          there is no need for the Court to obtain more information from the NAA. 
          The NAA's Motion explains neither why the record before the Court now 
          is insufficient nor how the NAA's proposed participation would cure 
          any alleged insufficiency. 
         To be sure, the NAA asserts that "[u]nless the Court permits NAA to 
          participate in the Act proceedings," a particular post-comment-period 
          proposed price increase "may not otherwise come to the Court's attention." 
          Motion at 6. But the Motion and its attachments, which are now part 
          of the record of this proceeding, belie that assertion. The proposed 
          price increase is described in a full paragraph in the Motion, discussed 
          in a four page letter attached to the Motion, Exhibit B to Motion, Letter 
          dated March 10, 2008, from Alan Marx to Karl Knutsen, and further discussed 
          in lengthy press clippings attached to that letter. Current newsprint 
          pricing is also discussed in the United State's response to NAA's comment. 
          By now, the Court's attention has been amply drawn to that proposal. 
         The NAA Motion does not indicate what, beyond that now well-highlighted 
          proposed price increase, the NAA's proposed participation would bring 
          to this proceeding that cannot be found in the evidence and argument 
          contained in the more than 200 pages of material which the NAA has submitted 
          to the Court. As Judge Kollar-Kotelly said of a similar proposal in 
          another Act proceeding by a commentor to offer expert testimony where 
          the expert's comments were already part of a comment, the NAA's "request 
          in this regard seems somewhat redundant in light of the lengthy comment 
          it submitted to the Department of Justice in response to the proposed 
          consent decree. . . . Because the Court is authorized 
          to consider [the] comments submitted to the Department of Justice, 15 
          U.S.C. § 16(f)(4), and because the Court has already received 
          and will review copies of [the] comments, . . . the Court 
          considers any additional participation by [the commentor] to be largely 
          superfluous." United States v. Microsoft Corp., 2002 WL 319436, 
          at *3 (D.D.C., Feb. 20, 2002). 
        
Denying The NAA's Motion Will Not Preclude The Court 
            From Gathering Additional Information Should It Subsequently Determine 
            It To Be Necessary 

 The Court need not be concerned that denying the NAA's Motion would 
          leave the Court without resources should it later conclude that the 
          information in the record is insufficient to make the Court's public 
          interest determination. In the unlikely event that the Court concludes 
          that it needs additional information, the Act's provisions allowing 
          the Court to gather further information remain in place. 15 U.S.C. §  
          16(f). The Act does not limit the Court's exercise of its sound discretion 
          in this respect, see AT&T, 552 F. Supp. at 218 
          ("congressional reports and hearings . . . repeatedly emphasized 
          that the court conducting a Tunney Act proceeding would have the widest 
          possible latitude in choosing the appropriate method for collecting 
          the information necessary to make its decision and that the various 
          means specified in the subsection were to be regarded as permissive"), 
          except by the general principle that "the trial judge will adduce the 
          necessary information through the least . . . complicated 
          and least time-consuming means possible," Senate Report at 6. The Court 
          will be able to obtain the information it considers necessary, and, 
          we add, may do so without designating any supplier of that information 
          as "amicus" or as "intervenor." See 15 U.S.C. § 16(f)(3) 
          (authorized modes of participation include participation as amicus or 
          intervenor, but also "any other manner and extent which serves the public 
          interest as the court may deem appropriate"). 
        

CONCLUSION

 For the foregoing reasons, the Court should deny the NAA's Motion.

FOOTNOTES

1.  Both the NAA's comment and the United States' 
          response have been filed with the Court. 
        2. The NAA notes that it may seek to intervene if 
          the Court denies its request to appear as amicus, but it has not yet 
          moved to intervene. The United States will appropriately respond to 
          any intervention motion, should one be made. 
        3. In the meantime, defendants Abitibi and Bowater 
          have completed their merger and become AbitibiBowater Inc. AbitibiBowater 
          sold the Snowflake, Arizona paper mill to Catalyst Paper Corporation, 
          a Canadian firm based in Vancouver, BC, on April 10, 2008..

          Reform, 1984 Duke L.J. 887, 903 (1984). Rather, the Court's task 
          is only to determine whether to perform the "judicial act," United 
          States v. Swift & Co., 286 U.S. 106, 115 (1932), of entering 
          the decree proposed by the parties as the Court's decree. In carrying 
          out that task, the Court must be mindful of the congressional purpose 
          to preserve the role of the consent decree in effective antitrust enforcement, 
          see S. Rep. No. 93-298 at 5 (1973) ("Senate Report") ("the 
          consent decree is of crucial importance as an enforcement tool, since 
          it permits the allocation of resources elsewhere"); 119 Cong. Rec. 24,600 
          (1973) (Statement of Sen. Gurney) (Tunney Act "is designed to enhance 
          the value and effectiveness of the consent decree as a tool of public 
          policy"), a purpose which would be threatened by transforming the Court's 
          public interest determination into a process resembling a trial. 
        5. Senate Report at 6 ("[w]here the public interest
